<h1>NikGapps core with google assistant</h1>
<p>Recently I realised that I couldn't enable hotword support for google assistant on my OnePlus 11 with LineageOS 21 on it. Doing some reasearch I found that 
    you need to have the google app install as a privaliged system app. I then realised that the stock and full versions of NikGapps (which is the gapps package
    I use) include google assistant (without mentioning it). I didn't want to install the full or stock versions so I modified the core version to include assistant.
    I moved the AppSet/GoogleSearch folder over to the core one and copied some stuff from common/install.sh over as well. You can find it 
    <a href="https://setofallsets.dev/downloads/nikgapps-core-with-assistant-android-14(UNOFFICIAL).zip">here</a>.</p>
